Changes in 0.2 Build 113 (02-10-2006) - Beta 2
      Features:
        - No need to doubleclick a table item to edit it, just click the line to load the values.
        - Changed text to right alignment in forms.
        - Issue #1 - User can restrict item listing by the blueprints in assets via a checkbox.
        - Issue #3 - Now user can delete more than 1 blueprint at the same time, just selecting using Ctrl or Shift.
        - Issue #6 - Now the user has the option to allow the application substract the mineral needs and BP runs from 
          the Stock and assets when the item is put in "Build" status.
        - Issue #8 - Clicking the window toolbar button for an already open windows brings it to the front instead of 
          displaying a message.
        - Issue #10 - Now all components stretch and resizes when the user maximizes or resizes the internal windows.
        - Issue #18 - Confirmation dialog on character deletion

          capital ships, blueprints).
