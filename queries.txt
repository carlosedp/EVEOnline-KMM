------- Selects the buildable modules -----------------

SELECT module.typename "Module", module.typeID "typeID"

Lets also have the Sales Tab pull information for any records "On Sale" so we can put a sale price and Blueprint Cost and have it show margins.

Also, we should have the Sales Tab automatically calculate taxes if we tell it to. Maybe only if we set a certain cell to True or a value, it will add taxes in on the specific Sale Record. I know I would not sell a Revelation on market =)

 

Here are the skill descriptions:

Accounting:

Proficiency at squaring away the odds and ends of business transactions, keeping the check books tight. Each level of skill reduces transaction tax by 10%.

 

Broker Relations:

Proficiency at driving down market-related costs. Each level of skill grants a 5% reduction in the costs associated with setting up a market order, which usually come to 1% of the order's total value. This can be further influenced by the player's standing towards the owner of the station where the order is entered.

 

Broker Relations deducts 1% when a order is placed. Transaction Tax deducts 1% when the item is actually bought or sold.
